# CUFE2024 JRPG
A JRPG clone made as a project to illustrate the uses and types of data structures and algorithms in gaming. 

## Description
A high level overview of how things work, what this is, etc. As well as a "how to play" guide with the controls and whatnot. NOTE: This readme isn't done yet and is merely a shell for what will eventually be the readme.

## Systems

### Rendering
### Entity Component System 
### Combat
### AI
### More stuff

## Dependencies 
- SDL2

## Future Work
These are things we would like to add in the future as a way to further improve this project and our own skills. Some of these are things that we had originally planned to add but couldn't due to tight time constraints. 
- Different attack types

  Originally, the idea was for there to be three different of attacks; light attack, regular attack, and heavy attack. The lighter the attack, the less damaging it is, but also the more accurate. Removed since we didn't have enough time to properly verify it worked. 
- Evasion mechanic

  Right now, when you target an enemy or an enemy targets you for an attack, it's a 100% hit. We wanted to make it so that there's some chance to hit and some chance to miss. It's an easy add, but we elected not to as we didn't have enough time to properly verify it worked correctly.
- Items and an inventory system

  Adding items that could do things like quick heal, quick AP restore, etc., as well as an inventory system with limits and so on.
